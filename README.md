## üìÅ Project Structure

### Backend
- **Location**: `backend` folder
- **Technologies**: Node.js, MySQL
- **Description**: Handles the server-side logic and database management.

### Frontend
- **Location**: `frontend` folder
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JS

## ‚ú® Features

- A responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A dynamic homepage displaying real-time discounted courses.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - A blog section for the admin to upload and manage content.
  - A post section for the admin to upload and manage content.
  - A user section to check all users and delete them.
  - Admin dashboard has to be manually accessed by going to `<frontend_url>/Frontend/html/admin.html` (usually it is `http://127.0.0.1:5500/Frontend/html/admin.html`).
- Implemented a scheduling feature to set specific publish times for each post.
- Allowed users to browse and select courses (without login).
- Developed a flow that redirects to a dummy payment page after course selection (login required).
- Implemented a dummy two-step verification for payment security.
- Provided multiple dummy payment options, including credit card, debit card, and UPI.
- Used MySQL for database management, setting up tables for blog content, course details, user transactions, and scheduling.
- Ensured seamless frontend-backend connection for real-time data updates.
- The backend port must be 3000 as in HTML, CSS, JS frontend we can't use .env for variables.
- Using jwt (JsonWebToken) for user authorization.
- **.env file** in Backend should contain these variables:
  - PORT (set it to 3000)
  - DB_HOST 
  - DB_USER
  - DB_PASS
  - DB_NAME (set it to blog_db if you are importing mine)
  - SECRET_KEY (ex- privateKey123)
  - FRONTEND_URL (set it to http://127.0.0.1:5500)
